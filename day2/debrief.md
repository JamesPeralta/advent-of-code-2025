1. Was able to get day 1 but just brute force. Couldn't think of a way to make it more optimal.
Maybe need to revisit.. Actually have no idea.
2. Learned this operation return chunk * (len(num_str) // size) == num_str.
  I didn't know how I would check the chunks but this is a cool operation to check the chunks.

3. Could probably read from a file instead.
